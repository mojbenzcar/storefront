1. About
storefront - storefront is a generic e-commerce web application written in Java.  


2. Installation

pre-requisites:
Maven 3.0 (2.xx may work)
Apache Tomcat 7.0 (6.xx may work)
MySQL 5.1
Java - I used servlet spec 3.0 so JavaSE 1.6 at least is req'd



At the root of the project, run:
tomcat_directory/bin/startup.sh
mysql -u root_user -p < sql
mvn tomcat6:deploy
Then navigate to localhost:8081/storefront and the application should be running.
